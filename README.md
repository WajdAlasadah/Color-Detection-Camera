üé• Color Detection Using Laptop Camera
This project performs real-time color detection using the built-in laptop camera. The program opens the camera, captures live video, and analyzes the colors in the frame to identify the dominant color (such as red, green, or blue). Once a color is detected, its name is displayed on the screen.

The project was developed using Visual Studio and runs on any computer with a built-in webcam.

‚öôÔ∏è Project Idea
The idea is to access the laptop‚Äôs camera in real time, capture frames, and analyze the pixel values to detect the main color in the frame or at the center. The detected color name is then displayed on the screen.

üß† Project Goals
Learn how to access and use the laptop camera in a desktop application.

Practice basic image and video processing.

Build a simple real-time computer vision application.

Understand how RGB values represent colors.

üõ†Ô∏è Tools and Technologies Used
Visual Studio

Programming Language: C# (or C++ depending on the version)

Image processing libraries: AForge.NET, Emgu CV, or OpenCV

‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run the Project
Open the project in Visual Studio.

Run the program.

The laptop's built-in webcam will open automatically.

Point the camera at any colored object.

The detected color name will be shown on screen.

üìå Notes
The project uses the laptop‚Äôs internal camera ‚Äî no external camera is needed.

Good lighting improves the accuracy of color detection.

This project can be expanded to detect more colors or use AI techniques to improve accuracy.
